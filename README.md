# Sockshop-Altschool
 This project is about deploying a microservices-based application using automated tools to ensure quick, reliable, and secure deployment on Kubernetes
 Socks Shop Microservices Deployment on Kubernetes
Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of a microservices-based application, the Socks Shop, on a Kubernetes cluster using Infrastructure as Code (IaaC). We automate the setup and deployment process for quick, reliable, and secure application delivery. The deployment includes monitoring, logging, and security features such as HTTPS with Let's Encrypt, Prometheus for monitoring, and network perimeter security.

Prerequisites
To successfully deploy this project, ensure that you have the following:

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Provider: AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.
Terraform: For infrastructure provisioning.
Ansible: For configuration management and automation.
Kubernetes Cluster: Managed Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS) or a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster.
kubectl: To manage and deploy resources to your Kubernetes cluster.
Helm: For managing Kubernetes packages (optional).
Prometheus & Grafana: For monitoring and metrics visualization.
Let’s Encrypt: For securing the application with HTTPS.
Ansible Vault: For encrypting sensitive data.
Architecture
The application uses a microservices architecture, deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. Key components include:

Socks Shop Microservices: Multiple services representing different parts of the e-commerce store (e.g., catalog, cart, orders).
Ingress Controller: Manages traffic routing to the services with HTTPS encryption using Let's Encrypt.
Prometheus & Grafana: For monitoring and visualization of the system's health and performance metrics.
Alertmanager: Integrated with Prometheus to manage alerts and notify when something goes wrong.
Logging: Prometheus handles application logs for analysis.
Infrastructure as Code Setup
1. Provision Infrastructure with Terraform
Use Terraform to provision the infrastructure on your chosen IaaS provider. This includes setting up a Kubernetes cluster, networking, and security groups.

Initialize Terraform:

bash
Copy code
cd terraform/
terraform init
Deploy Infrastructure:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
Outputs: Terraform will output the necessary details like Kubernetes API server endpoint and kubeconfig credentials.

2. Configure Kubernetes Cluster with Ansible
Ansible is used to configure your Kubernetes cluster, deploy the Socks Shop microservices, and manage configurations.

Run Ansible Playbooks:
bash
Copy code
cd ansible/
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy_kubernetes.yaml
This playbook deploys Kubernetes manifests, sets up Ingress for HTTPS, and installs Helm charts if needed.

Deployment Pipeline
The deployment pipeline consists of the following steps:

Terraform: Provisions the infrastructure (Kubernetes cluster, networking, etc.).
Ansible: Configures the cluster and deploys the application.
Kubernetes Manifests: Deploy the microservices using Kubernetes YAML files.
Automated Scripts: Automate the entire process using a deployment script.
bash
Copy code
./scripts/deploy.sh
Monitoring and Logging
We use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor and visualize the application's metrics.

Deploy Prometheus & Alertmanager:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f prometheus/prometheus.yaml
kubectl apply -f prometheus/alertmanager.yaml
Deploy Grafana:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f grafana/grafana.yaml
Access Grafana: After deploying, access Grafana via the Ingress URL to monitor your cluster using pre-configured dashboards.

Security
1. Enable HTTPS with Let's Encrypt
We secure the application using Let's Encrypt to obtain and manage SSL certificates for HTTPS.

Deploy Cert-Manager:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/cert-manager.yaml
Configure Ingress with HTTPS: The Ingress manifest is configured to handle HTTPS traffic and uses Let’s Encrypt for certificate management.

2. Network Security Rules
Implement network perimeter security by defining security groups, firewall rules, or Kubernetes NetworkPolicies.

Define NetworkPolicies in your Kubernetes cluster to restrict access between microservices.
bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/networkpolicy.yaml
3. Ansible Vault for Sensitive Data
Encrypt sensitive data such as API keys and credentials using Ansible Vault.

Encrypt a file:

bash
Copy code
ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/all/vault.yml
Decrypt a file:

bash
Copy code
ansible-vault decrypt group_vars/all/vault.yml
Bonus Features
Network Perimeter Security: Apply security group rules to control ingress and egress traffic to your infrastructure.
Ansible Vault: Use Ansible Vault to secure sensitive configuration variables.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the automated deployment of a microservices-based application on Kubernetes using modern DevOps practices like Infrastructure as Code. By leveraging tools like Terraform, Ansible, Prometheus, and Let's Encrypt, the application is deployed securely, monitored effectively, and can be scaled and managed with ease.
